Self-eval: https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/recursive-koodotk/blob/a8583ecf2bcd71001a4c74c0cb46c5f8163a5732/2/self-2.md \
Score: 10/80 \
Grader: Rajat Keshri \

Reasons: \

*Expected total marks --> 80. \
Actual total marks --> 20 (see below reason). \
You utilized null to represent empty slots with documentation, which brings down your total programming points to 20 from 80. This is not good design and you will run into trouble with this. Think of another way to represent the lack of a tile. See Matthias or Ben if you have more questions.

After evaluating, you have lost 10 points. You were expected to get a total of 70/80, but due to the use of null, you have been scored on the scale of 20 and recieved 10/80.*

Self eval and Board - \
40/40 pts: an operation that determines the reachable tiles from some spot 
- [10/10] : is there a data def. for "coordinates" (places to go to)? 
- [10/10] : is there a signature/purpose statement? 
- [10/10] : is it clear how the method/function checks for cycles? 
- [10/10] : is there at least one unit test with a non-empty expected result 


20/30 pts: an operation for sliding a row or column in a direction \
- [10/10] sig/purp. 
- [0/10] the method should check that row/column has even index 
- [10/10] unit tests: at least one for rows and one for columns 

10/10: the functinality for inserting a tile into the open space \
- [5/5] : an operation for rotating and inserting the spare tile 
- [5/5] Provide clarity on what happens to the tile that's pushed out 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Design and data representation (ungraded)- \

- Need to include more data about what the referee knows about players \
  - their assigned home \
  - their assigned color \
  - their assigned "goal" tile (private to ref and the player) \
  - their current tile (where the avatar is located) \
- Need to include information about the last action performed (so it is not undone by the next player)
