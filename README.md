# Labyrinth

**Labyrinth** is a maze-based board game where players navigate twisty passages to collect treasures and race back to their home tile to win.

## Game Overview

In Labyrinth, players explore a maze filled with hidden treasures and shifting pathways. The objective is to collect a designated treasure and be the first to return to your starting position.

## Game Board

The board consists of a **7x7 grid** of tiles, each displaying one of four connector shapes (`│`, `└`, `┬`, `┼`). These connectors form paths that link tiles together when their ends meet. Each tile also holds a unique, random pair of “gems,” which act as treasures.

**Board mechanics**:
- Rows and columns on the outer edges can slide left, right, up, or down, shifting tiles by one position.
- Sliding creates an open spot on the grid, which can be filled by a spare tile.
- Future expansions support larger grids for more complex mazes and gameplay.

## Setting Up

1. **Arrange the board** and place player avatars at their starting “home” tiles.
2. **Assign treasures** for each player to collect and return home.
3. **Place the spare tile** off the board.

## Playing a Turn

Each turn has three steps:
1. **Slide a Row/Column**: Choose an outer row or column to slide by one tile. This creates an empty spot and sets aside a dislodged tile as the new spare. You cannot reverse the previous player's move.
2. **Insert the Spare Tile**: Rotate the spare tile by 90° (if desired) and place it in the empty spot created by sliding the row or column.
3. **Move Your Avatar**: Move your avatar along the connected pathways. You must move it at least one tile, but only as far as the connectors allow.

## Winning the Game

- The game ends when a player collects their assigned treasure and returns to their starting position – they are the winner!
- Alternatively, if all players pass on their turn during a full round, the game also ends.

## Game Components

The game set includes:
- A **7x7 grid** for the board
- Enough **tiles** to fill each grid spot and one spare tile
- **Gem tokens** representing treasures
- Player avatars and matching home markers in distinct colors

## Future Expansions

This game is designed to support:
- **Larger grids** for extended mazes and gameplay variety in future expansions.
- **Networked play** to allow players to compete remotely, adding an extra layer of challenge and engagement.
