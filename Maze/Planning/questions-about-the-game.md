SUBJECT: Questions about the Labyrinth Project

We're getting started on the Labryrinth game, and we have the following questions on the spec:

1. If a player reverses a previous sliding action but places the spare tile back in with a different orientation 
   does that still count as an invalid move?
2. On the example board every single tile has an alexandrite-pear-shape gem on it. Is this part of the spec?
3. Are there any aspects of the game that might need any sort of human interface other than as an observer?
4. How is money represented? How much do players start with?
5. What is meant by fake versions of the gems? 
6. Are there different kinds of observers? Is there an observer that has a complete set of information and would 
   there be a player observer that can see their goal tile.
