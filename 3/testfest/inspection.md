Self-eval: https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/recursive-koodotk/blob/31e96aa41bce933b19721db5318177cda89e8755/3/self-3.md \

- (-38) Missing self eval. 
- (-5) Signature and purpose statement are unclear as to what a "rotation" means in the context of rotating a spare tile.
- (-5) Does not implement player movement.

The design's specification for how the player gets "context" could be clearer.
